## Technical Achievements

### 1. Styled the page using CSS (5 points)
I created a separate `style.css` file and applied multiple CSS rules:
- Set a **background color** for the body using my Adobe color palette.  
- Styled the **header** and navigation bar with a contrasting color.  
- Added styling for **tables** (borders, colors, padding).  
- Changed the appearance of **table headers and cells** with different palette colors.  
- Styled the **footer** with background and text colors.  


### 2. Used semantic HTML tags (5 points)
I expanded the HTML to use multiple semantic elements:
- `<header>` → contains the main title and navigation.  
- `<nav>` → navigation menu with links.  
- `<main>` → groups the main content of the page.  
- `<section>` → used to organize About, Experience, and Skills sections.  
- `<table>` → displays my skills and experience levels.  
- `<footer>` → page footer with copyright info.

## Design Achievements

### 1. Created a color palette with Adobe Color (10 points)
- The palette included these 5 colors:
  - `#F5D254` (gold)
  - `#B451F5` (purple)
  - `#419BF5` (blue)
  - `#65F584` (green)
  - `#F5744D` (orange/red)
- Each color is used in different parts of my site (body background, header, tables, footer, etc.).
- Screenshot of the palette is included in the repo as `palette.png`.

### 2. Used a Google Font (5 points)
- I imported the **Montserrat** font 
- The font is applied to the entire website via the `body` style in `style.css`.  
- This improved readability and gave the site a modern look.
